## 🎉 Success Story 🎉

My roommate used this code to ask out her boyfriend and HE SAID YESSSSS! Could this app be any more effective? I think not! 

## ✨ Features

- A cute bear gif that shows your love intentions
- A "Yes" button that grows larger with each rejection
- Creative and increasingly desperate "No" button text that changes with each click
- Adorable celebration animation when they finally say yes!

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Ask your crush to open the app
2. Watch as they try to click "No" (spoiler: it's futile)
3. The "Yes" button grows bigger with each rejection
4. The "No" button text becomes increasingly desperate
5. Eventually, they'll give in and click "Yes."
6. Celebrate with an adorable bear kiss animation!
